# Nepali-To-German
This is repository to make a ML model to translate Nepali to German (text-text).Later will be scaled to speech-speech <br>
Structure of the repository: <br>
-seq-seq.py <nr>
    This implementation consists of pre-trained transformers. The technique followed is pivoting Nepali-English and English-German. Two different pre-trained transformers are used. <br>
-translate.py<br>
    This implementation consists of the output file, which in first stage is text-text translation. Final model will be scaled to speech-speech+text translation<br>
